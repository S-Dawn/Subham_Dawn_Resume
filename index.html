						<h4>Deep-learning based approach with Code Embeddings to predict a patient’s readmission:</h4>
						<p>
							Using Doc2vec to embed the patient’s medical code using the time series data of the patient’s medical record
                            to feed to an LSTM model, the readmission of the patient was predicted.

						<h4>Quantum Machine Learning to learn patterns in Multiview Graph Networks:</h4>
						<p>
							Multiview graph networks are analyzed and features extracted using Graph Laplacian techniques and
                            QML to predict results from it.

                            Features of a multiview graph network can be extracted using laplacian techniques to determine the optimal cut.
                            Thus graph nodes were classified based on the features derived.
